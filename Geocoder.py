# Locate Geocoder with KML writing													 #
# Feed in a CSV, receive stdout Lat/Long and KML Long/Lat 							 #
# Author: Stephan Garland, Carroll White REMC										 #
# Shoutout to Wiktor Stribi≈ºew on StackOverflow for the regex						 #
# Directions: Create a CSV that has a header named Address, containing the address	 #
#             The regex is setup for USIC's naming scheme for addresses:			 #
#			  $HOUSE_NUM $STREET_NAME $TOWN $NEAREST_INTERSECTION					 #
#			  $INTERSECTING_STREET_1_NAME $TOWN $INTERSECTING_STREET_2_NAME			 #
#			  Run the script, import the KML into ArcEarth with your territory KML   #
# TODO: Create error checking for out-of-bounds addresses that don't code			 #
